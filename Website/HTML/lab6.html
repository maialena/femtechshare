            <div class="exercise">OVERVIEW</div>
            <p> Today we get to explore the wonderful world of JavaScript. By now your website is looking pretty snazzy. You've got the layout. You've got the style. But perhaps you feel there's something missing....like animation, or a search box, or an
                interactive form/survey, or give users feedback when they interact with your website in a particular way (like <a href="#"> this </a>). That's where JavaScript comes in.
            </p>
            <p> What exactly is JavaScript? And why learn it? Surprise!: it has nothing to do with Java. They are completely separate languages, despite the common name -- confusing, I know. Here's what the <span class="emphasis"> creators </span> of the
                language have to say about it: "JavaScript ("JS" for short) is a full-fledged dynamic programming language that, when applied to an HTML document, can provide dynamic interactivity on websites. It was invented by Brendan Eich, co-founder
                of the Mozilla project, the Mozilla Foundation, and the Mozilla Corporation. You can do pretty much anything with JavaScript. You'll start small with simple features such as carousels, image galleries, fluctuating layouts, and responses
                to button clicks. Eventually as you get more experienced with the language, you'll be able to create games, animated 2D and 3D graphics, full blown database-driven apps, and more!"
            </p>

            <p> Let's break some of those words down:
                <ul>
                    <li> A <span class="emphasis">dynamic programming langauge </span> is one that executes a lot of behavior during 'run time' that 'static programming languages' would execute at compile time. 'Run time' refers to the time that a program
                        is actually running. 'Compile time' refers to the time <em> before </em> a program is run, when it is checked for errors (usually syntax and 'typechecking' errors) by the <em> compiler </em>. Don't worry too much about the difference
                        between these if you're confused. It requires understanding of some 'low level' computer science stuff that's outside the scope of this course. </li>
                    <li> <span class="emphasis"> dynamic interactivivty </span> - this just means that JS allows users to interact with websites via forms, drop-down menus, etc.</li>

                </ul>
            </p>
            <p> JS is a <em> scripting </em> language, meaning that the code is <em> interpreted </em> instead of compiled by the web-browser. Without getting too much in the weeds here, a lanugage that is <em> interpreted </em> means that each line is executed
                one by one by the browser, top down, without any extra work. <em> Compilation </em> refers to an extra step performed by a <em> compiler </em> to transform the high level language (ie the source code that you write) into a 'lower level
                language,' which can then be translated into 0's and 1's.
            </p>

            You can read the Mozilla Foundation's full description of JS <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/What_is_JavaScript"> here </a> but we'll be going through most of the material together in class. Like we
            said before, JavaScript can do just about <em> anything </em>, including:
            <ol>
                <li> Make websites respond to users </li>
                <li> Build apps and games </li>
                <li> Access info on the internet (like Twitter feeds)</li>
                <li> Create a sign-up form</li>
                <li> Search box with autocompletion features (brings up suggestions based on what you've typed so far -- typing "de" for instance would signal "desert," "delaware," "dentist")</li>
                <li> Info that changes when you reload the page, like dates, times, sports match results, weather, stock market prices, etc.</li>
                <li> Drop down menu bar </li>
                <li> Organization and modification to the DOM (more on this this later)</li>
                <li> Animate elements on a page (ex: show/hide info, highlight sections, etc.)</li>
            </ol>
            <p> And in case you still need convincing that it's worth learning, check out what the creator of Wordpress <a href="http://wesbos.com/learn-javascript/">has to say about the language </a></p>

            <div class="exercise"> II. The OOP Approach </div>
            <p> In Object Oriented programming, <em> everything </em> is an object. What's an object? Think of them as 'containers' defined by two characteristics: state and behavior. State is a description of the object's characteristics (think adjective
                or quality or possession). Behavior is an action, or something that the object can do (think verb). </p>
            <p>Don't overthink this yet -- try to develop an intuitive understanding of an 'object' before you figure out how to create one. Objects are everwhere -- dogs, TV's, your desk, friends, a bicycle, this class, your bank account. We can model <em> anything </em>that
                has some characteristics and performs some behavior as an object. </li>
            </p>
            <p> We'll learn about classes, objects, and inheritance through an in-class exercise. If you miss class or want a refresher, walk through <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Details_of_the_Object_Model"> this </a>                tutorial</p>


            <li> Last but not least, read about <span class="emphasis"> String operations </span><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/Useful_string_methods">here </a></li>
            </ol>
            <div class="exercise"> III. The DOM</div>
            <div class="subtitle"> What is the DOM? </div>
            <p> The 'Document Object Model' is an <em> object oriented representation of the web page </em> that allows programmers to access and manipulate the content, style, and structure of HTML elements. A common way of manipulating the DOM is through
                JavaScript -- what we're going to do today. </p>
            <p>The DOM is made up of:
                <ol>
                    <li> A set of <span class="emphasis"> objects</span> </li>
                    <li> <span class="emphasis">A structure </span> of how these objects can be used/combined </li>
                    <li> <span class="emphasis">An interface </span> to access and modify them </li>
                </ol>
            </p>
            <p> The DOM is also referred to as the "DOM Tree" because it takes on a tree-like structure with 'branches' and 'leaves.' Trees are a fundamental data structure for most programming languages, so we'll go over them in more detail below. </p>
            <!--GO OVER THIS WITH THEM: http://htmldog.com/guides/javascript/intermediate/thedom/ -->
            <p>Key terms:
                <ol>
                    <li> <span class="emphasis">Tree </span> - a way to represent data in a hierarchial 'tree-like' structure (we'll see examples of this that'll make it clearer). </li>
                    <li> <span class="emphasis">Root </span> the top node of a tree, from which all other 'child nodes' and subtrees branch. It has no 'parents.'</li>
                    <li> <span class="emphasis"> Node </span> - an element or entry on a tree. Everything on you webpage is a node in the DOM. Each node has three attributes;
                        <ul>
                            <li> nodeType -- this is an integer value from 1 to 12 representing the type of node (e.g. "1" represents an element, "2" represents an attribute, "3" represents text, etc). For a full list of the 12 types of nodes, <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/prop_node_nodetype.asp"> Read here </a></li>
                            <li> nodeName -- this is the name of the node as a string (e.g. name of the body element is "BODY.") </li>
                            <li> nodeValue -- for element nodes, the value will be null (i.e. 'no value'). For text nodes, the value is the text itself. For attribute nodes, the value is the attribute itself. </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p> Say you have the following div element in your page: </p>
                        <pre class="output"><span class="input"> &ltdiv id="about"&gt Welcome to FemTechShare, a course on web design. &lt/div&gt  </span></pre>
                        <p> You can learn info about this node as follows:</p>
                        <pre class="output"><span class="input"> var element = document.getElementById("about");  </span></pre>
                        <pre class="output"><span class="input"> alert(element.nodeType) //displays 1 </span></pre>
                        <pre class="output"><span class="input"> alert(element.nodeName) // displays "DIV" </span></pre>
                        <pre class="output"><span class="input"> alert(element.nodeValue) // displays null  </span></pre>
                        <br/>
                        <div class="checkoff"> NOTE: alert("text"); displays an alert box with a specific message and an OK button. To test this out, "Inspect" this page and go to the Console tab. Type alert("whatever you want here"); and push enter </div>

                    </li>
                    <li> <span class="emphasis">Parent Node - </span> a node that is one level 'higher' (towards the top) than a child node, connecting </li>
                    <li> <span class="emphasis">Child Node - </span> an entry branching from a parent, one level 'deeper' in the tree -- think of the tree as growing <em> downward </em> such that the children are closer to the bottom of the structure</li>
                    <li> <span class="emphasis">Leaf</span> - nodes without children</li>
                    <li> <span class="emphasis">Branch</span> - the edges connecting nodes together</li>
                </ol>
            </p>

            <p> Here's a lecture slide from <em>CS61A: 'The Structure & Interpretation of Computer Programs'</em> of the tree for your reference:

                <img align="center" width="500px" height="500px" align="center" src="../images/the_tree.png" />
            </p>
            <div class="subtitle"> Accessing Elements via the Dom </div>
            <p> * NOTE: The below information was borrowed from <a href="http://www.elated.com/articles/looking-inside-dom-page-elements/"> this article </a>from elated.com. </a>
            </p>
            <p> Next thing to know is how to access elements on your HTML page with JavaScript. We use the <code> document </code> object to do so, using the built-in methods listed below: </p>
            <ol>
                <li> document.getElementById
                    <pre class="output"><span class="input"> var detailElem = document.getElementById("details")  </span></pre>
                    <p> Now we've grabbed the elements (e.g. div's, p's, li's, etc.) with the id "details." We can now change their color or size, or declare some other function to do something when those elements are clicked or hovered over</p>
                </li>
                <br/>
                <li> document.getElementsByTagName
                    <pre class="output"><span class="input"> var paragraphs = document.getElementsByTagName("p")  </span></pre>
                    <p> This works the same way as getElementById except that we've grabbed a tag (a, li, p, body, etc.). This method returns a 'NodeList' which is an Array of the DOM elements that were selected. To change them all, you can iterate over the
                        elements in the list in a loop.</p>
                </li>

                <li> document.getElementsByClassName</li>
                <pre class="output"><span class="input"> var articles = document.getElementById("articles")  </span></pre>
                <p> This is the same as getElementsByTagName except we're accessing elements based on their class name. This method also returns a NodeList of DOM elements with the same class, which can be iterated over in a loop</p>
                </li>
            </ol>

            <div class="checkoff"> NOTE: There are more ways to access DOM objects, but these are the most common </div>
            <br/>

            <p> Once you have a node, you can access other nodes related to it. All nodes have the following built-in properties: </p>
            <ol>
                <li>childNodes - a collection of all the node's children</li>
                <li>firstChild - the first child in the collection of children nodes </li>
                <li>lastChild - the last child in the collection of children nodes</li>
                <li>nextSibling - the next node with the same parent as the selected node </li>
                <li>previousSibling - the previous node with the same parent as the selected node </li>
                <li>parentNode - the node's parent </li>
            </ol>

            <p> Say we had the following elements in our web page: </p>
            <pre class="output"><span class="input"> &ltul&gt </span></pre>
            <pre class="output"><span class="input">    &ltli id="item1"&gt &lta href="www.fakewebsite1.com"&gt   Hey there what's up? &lt/a&gt&lt/li&gt</span></pre>
            <pre class="output"><span class="input">    &ltli id="item2"&gt &lta href="www.fakewebsite2.com"&gt Not much, how about you? &lt/a&gt &lt/li&gt</span></pre>
            <pre class="output"><span class="input">    &ltli&gt id="item3"&gt &lta href="www.fakewebsite3.com"&gt   Good, thanks for asking. &lt/a&gt &lt/li&gt</span></pre>
            <pre class="output"><span class="input">&lt/ul&gt</span></pre>
            <p> Q: How would you access the text "Not much, how about you?" </p>
            <p> A: With the following code:</p>
            <pre class="output"><span class="input"> var item2Text = document.getElementById("item2"); </span></pre>
            <pre class="output"><span class="input"> alert(item2Text.firstChild.firtChild.nodeValue); </span></pre>
            <p> Why does this work? Because getElementById returns the second 'id' object and stores it in the variable item2Text. item2Text.firstChild returns the &lta&gt node. Calling .firstChild again returns the firstChild of the &lta&gt node, which is
                the text node "Not much, how about you." To access the text itself, you need to use nodeValue. </p>
            <br/>
            <div class="subtitle"> Getting Attributes </div>
            <p> Selecting attributes in the DOM is a bit different than getting tags or elements by id. You access an element's attributes with the <code> attributes </code> property like so:
                <pre class="output"><span class="input"> var elemAttributes = [element].attributes </span></pre>
            </p>
            <p>This returns a collection of all the attributes, which you can iterate through in a loop to change individually.
                <br/> Here's an example - say you have the following image on your webpage: </p>
            <pre class="output"><span class="input"> &lt img id="favPic" height="500px" width="400px" src="images/pic.jpg" /&gt </span></pre>
            <p> You can use the following code to display the attributes: </p>
            <pre class="output"><span class="input"> var output = ""; </span></pre>
            <pre class="output"><span class="input"> var image = document.getElementById("favPic"); </span></pre>
            <pre class="output"><span class="input"> var attributes = image.attributes </span></pre>
            <pre class="output"><span class="input"> for (i=0; i < attributes.length; i ++) {</span></pre>
            <pre class="output"><span class="input">    output +=(attributes[i].name + "=" + attributes[i].value ) + '\n' }</span></pre>
            <pre class="output"><span class="input"> alert(output) </span></pre>
            <p> This code has some things that we haven't gone over yet (like loops and string concatenatoin). Ignore that for now. The big take-away is that we can retrieve and manipulate an element's attributes using the '.attributes' property.</p>

            <div class="subtitle"> Changing Contents of an Element </div>
            <p> So you know how to retrieve an element as well as look deep inside the DOM to access an element's nodes and parents. But how do you change the contents of an element? </p>
            <p> One way is to simply assign a new value to the elements .nodeValue property. Say we have the following code on our webpage: </p>
            <pre class="output"><span class="input">    &ltli id="greeting"&gt &lta href="www.fakewebsite.com"&gt Yo yo yo &lt/a&gt &lt/li&gt</span></pre>
            <br/>We can change the text like so:
            <pre class="output"><span class="input">var text = document.getElementById("greeting");</span></pre>
            <pre class="output"><span class="input">text.firstChild.firstChild.nodeValue = "hey hey hey"</span></pre>
            <br/>
            <p> If you want to make bigger changes -- like adding a new paragraph of text to the page -- you can do so by adding new nodes! To do so, you can create a new element like so:
                <pre class="output"><span class="input"> var newElem = document.createElement(<em>tagName</em>) </span></pre> <br/>Then add it as a child to an existing node:
                <pre class="output"><span class="input"> existingElement.appendChild(newElem); </span></pre> <br/>You can also add the new node before the existing node with:
                <pre class="output"><span class="input"> existingElement.insertBefore(newElem); </span></pre> Like .createElement, you can use .createTextNode("insert text here") to create a text node (duh).<br/>
            </p>
            <p> You can also remove a node by first retrieving it the usual way (e.g. getElementByID or element.firstChild()), and then removing it from its parent like so:
                <pre class="output"><span class="input"> removedElem = parent.removeChild(elementToRemove);</span></pre> The method <code> removeChild </code> removes the elementToRemove and <em> returns </em> it. You can either store the removed element
                in a variable like above (which might come in handy if you want to put it in a different spot on the page) or discard it altogether.
            </p>
            <p> Next, you can replace items on the page. There's a few ways to do this. One is a bit convoluted: you remove the node you want to replace from its parent, create a new node containing the content you want to replace it with, and append the
                new node to the existing parent. Here's an example of that (note: this example is taken from <a href="http://www.elated.com/articles/changing-page-elements-with-the-dom/"> here </a>:</p>
            <pre class="output"><span class="input"> var welcome = document.getElementById( "welcome" );</span></pre>
            <pre class="output"><span class="input"> var oldChild = welcome.lastChild;</span></pre>
            <pre class="output"><span class="input"> welcome.removeChild( oldChild );</span></pre>
            <pre class="output"><span class="input"> var newPara = document.createElement( "p" );</span></pre>
            <pre class="output"><span class="input"> newPara.appendChild( document.createTextNode( "Feel free to have a browse." ) );</span></pre>
            <pre class="output"><span class="input">  welcome.appendChild( newPara );</span></pre>
            <br/>
            <p> A better way to do all that is with <code> replaceChild(). </code> This takes in two arguments: the existing node, and the node you want to replace it with. Here's the above code rewritten with <code> replaceChild</code>:
                <pre class="output"><span class="input"> var welcome = document.getElementById( "welcome" );</span></pre>
                <pre class="output"><span class="input"> var oldChild = welcome.lastChild;</span></pre>
                <pre class="output"><span class="input"> var newPara = document.createElement( "p" );</span></pre>
                <pre class="output"><span class="input"> newPara.appendChild( document.createTextNode( "Feel free to have a browse." ) );</span></pre>
                <pre class="output"><span class="input">  welcome.replaceChild( newPara, oldChild );</span></pre>
            </p>
            <p> Last but not least, you have all the tools to move nodes around and change attributes. Rather than replicating the example here, take five minutes to read <a href="http://www.elated.com/articles/changing-page-elements-with-the-dom/"> this article </a>                Scroll down to "Moving Elements Around." We did the first few exercises together above, so you can skip over those. </p>

            <div class="exercise"> IV. javaScript Basics </div>
            <div class="subtitle"> Your first program </div>
            <p> For this program, we're going to learn a real nifty tool that comes with most web browsers: Scratchpad. So that we're on the same page, you might want to use Chrome (what I'll be referring to in this tutorial). You can download <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Scratchpad">ScratchPad for Chrome  </a>                for free as an extension. <br/>Scratchpad is a JavaScript tool that allows you to write and run code that interacts with your window. </p>

            <ol>
                <li> Once you've downloaded Scratchpad, open up Chrome and navigate to your favorite site. </li>
                <li> On the top-right hand corner of the browser, click the symbol with the three horizontal lines: </li>
                <br/>
                <img width="400px" height="300px" src="../images/three_line_symbol.png" />
                <br/>
                <li> Click 'More Tools' >> 'Developer Tools' like so:</li>
                <br/>
                <img width="400px" height="300px" src="../images/developer_tools.png" />
                <br/>
                <li> Click the double right-arrow symbol: '>>' and select "Scratch JS". Your screen should look something like this:</li>
                <br/>
                <img width="400px" height="300px" src="../images/scratch_js.png">
                <br/>
                <li> Now let's write your first program! We'll disect each part of the code below, but for now just copy and paste it into your browser:</li>
                <br/>
                <img width="400px" height="300px" src="../images/scratch_code.png">
                <br/>
                <li> Click "Run" at the bottom right hand of the Scratchpad. </li>

            </ol>
            <br/> Cool, right?!
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <div class="subtitle"> Boolean Logic</div>
            <p> We know that javaScript can do basic math and represent data as Strings. Now let's learn about <span class="emphasis"> boolean logic </span> </p>
            <p class="emphasis"> <em>Say hello to the 'if/else' statement. </em></p>
            <p> Let's write an if/else program in Scratchpad:
                <pre class="output"> &lt <span class="input"> if ("myName".length >= 5){ console.log("You have a long name!");} </span> </pre>

                <p> NOTE: Now we're writing to the console, which is a window that logs info about the current web page, including errors in your code, warnings, network information, etc. Click "Run" on Scratchpad, then move over to the "Console" tab to see
                    if your message was printed </p>
                <div class="checkoff"> Pro Tip: The method console.log("stuff") is equivalent to the 'print' statement you see in other languages. This is a GREAT way to debug your code if it is not running how you'd expect. The idea is to throw print statements all throughout
                    your program and run it. When you hit an error in your code, the browser will just stop running your code entirely. If you have two print statements sandwiching your code, and the first statement printed but the second didn't, you've
                    arrowed down the area of your code that the error is occuring! You can apply the same strategy to just that area of code (write more print statements and see which ones don't get printed) until you narrow down the error to one or two
                    lines. Usually errors occur with simple syntax mistakes, so by then the fix should be more obvious. </div>
