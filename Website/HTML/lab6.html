        <div class="heading">WEEK 6: Intro to JavaScript</div>
        <div class="exercise">OVERVIEW</div>
        <p> Today we get to explore the wonderful world of JavaScript. By now your website is looking pretty snazzy. You've got the layout. You've got the style. But perhaps you feel there's something missing....like animation, or a search box, or an interactive
            form/survey, or give users feedback when they interact with your website in a particular way (like <a href="#"> this </a>). That's where JavaScript comes in.
        </p>
        <p> What exactly is JavaScript? And why learn it? Surprise!: it has nothing to do with Java. They are completely separate languages, despite the common name -- confusing, I know. Here's what the <span class="emphasis"> creators </span> of the language
            have to say about it: "JavaScript ("JS" for short) is a full-fledged dynamic programming language that, when applied to an HTML document, can provide dynamic interactivity on websites. It was invented by Brendan Eich, co-founder of the Mozilla
            project, the Mozilla Foundation, and the Mozilla Corporation. You can do pretty much anything with JavaScript. You'll start small with simple features such as carousels, image galleries, fluctuating layouts, and responses to button clicks.
            Eventually as you get more experienced with the language, you'll be able to create games, animated 2D and 3D graphics, full blown database-driven apps, and more!"
        </p>
        <p> Let's break some of those words down:
            <ul>
                <li> A <span class="emphasis">dynamic programming langauge </span> is one that executes a lot of behavior during 'run time' that 'static programming languages' would execute at compile time. 'Run time' refers to the time that a program is actually
                    running. 'Compile time' refers to the time <em> before </em> a program is run, when it is checked for errors (usually syntax and 'typechecking' errors) by the <em> compiler </em>. Don't worry too much about the difference between these
                    if you're confused. It requires understanding of some 'low level' computer science stuff that's outside the scope of this course. </li>
                <li> <span class="emphasis"> dynamic interactivivty </span> - this just means that JS allows users to interact with websites via forms, drop-down menus, etc.</li>

            </ul>
        </p>
        <p> JS is a <em> scripting </em> language, meaning that the code is <em> interpreted </em> instead of compiled by the web-browser. Without getting too much in the weeds here, a lanugage that is <em> interpreted </em> means that each line is executed
            one by one by the browser, top down, without any extra work. <em> Compilation </em> refers to an extra step performed by a <em> compiler </em> to transform the high level language (ie the source code that you write) into a 'lower level language,'
            which can then be translated into 0's and 1's.
        </p>

        You can read the Mozilla Foundation's full description of JS <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/What_is_JavaScript"> here </a> but we'll be going through most of the material together in class. Like we said
        before, JavaScript can do just about <em> anything </em>, including:
        <ol>
            <li> Make websites respond to users </li>
            <li> Build apps and games </li>
            <li> Access info on the internet (like Twitter feeds)</li>
            <li> Create a sign-up form</li>
            <li> Search box with autocompletion features (brings up suggestions based on what you've typed so far -- typing "de" for instance would signal "desert," "delaware," "dentist")</li>
            <li> Info that changes when you reload the page, like dates, times, sports match results, weather, stock market prices, etc.</li>
            <li> Drop down menu bar </li>
            <li> Organization and modification to the DOM (more on this this later)</li>
            <li> Animate elements on a page (ex: show/hide info, highlight sections, etc.)</li>
        </ol>
        <p> And in case you still need convincing that it's worth learning, check out what the creator of Wordpress <a href="http://wesbos.com/learn-javascript/">has to say about the language </a></p>
        So without further ado, <span class="emphasis">let's get started!</span>

        </ol>

        <div class="exercise"> II. The OOP Approach </div>
        <p> In Object Oriented programming, <em> everything </em> is an object. What's an object? Think of them as as 'containers' defined by two characteristics: state and behavior. State is a description of the object's characteristics (think adjective
            or quality or possession). Behavior is an action, or something that the object can do (think verb). Don't overthink this yet -- try to develop an intuitive understanding of an 'object' before you figure out how to create one. Objects are everwhere
            -- dogs, TV's, your desk, friends, a bicycle, this class, your bank account. We can model <em> anything </em>that has some characteristics and performs some behavior as an object. </li>
        </p>
        <p> We'll learn about classes, objects, and inheritance through an in-class exercise. If you miss class or want a refresher, walk through <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Details_of_the_Object_Model"> this </a>            tutorial</p>


        <li> Last but not least, read about <span class="emphasis"> String operations </span><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/Useful_string_methods">here </a></li>
        </ol>
        <div class="exercise"> III. The DOM</div>
        <div class="subtitle"> What is the DOM? </div>
        <p> Think of the 'Document Object Model' as a <em> standard </em> that allows programs to dynamically access and manipulate the content, style, and structure of elements on your web page. The DOM is made up of:
            <ol>
                <li> A set of <span class="emphasis"> objects</span> </li>
                <li> <span class="emphasis">A structure </span> of how these objects can be used/combined </li>
                <li> <span class="emphasis">An interface </span> to access and modify them </li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <span class="emphasis"> Guess what? </span>You've been using the DOM this whole time! Read <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Learn/CSS/Introduction_to_CSS/How_CSS_works"> here </a> about how the browser turns HTMl into a DOM & applies
        CSS to parts of the DOM. For a more complete description of the DOM in general, read all about <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction"> here, </a>though we'll be going over most of the content
        together as a class.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <div class="checkoff"> Quiz: test yourself on these key terms. Without looking at the answers, turn to the person next to you and try to give a definition of 'object,' 'data type,' & 'interface' in your own words </div>

        <p> Last step before we get more into the gory details of how the DOM works: let's define an REALLY important
            <span class="emphasis"> data structure </span> that will help us understand the DOM.
            <br/> Introducing "THE TREE"
            <ol>
                <li> <span class="emphasis">Tree </span> - a way to represent data in a hierarchial (upside down)'tree-like' structure (we'll see examples of this that'll make it clearer). </li>
                <li> <span class="emphasis">Root </span> the top node of a tree, from which all other 'child nodes' and subtrees branch. It has no 'parents.'</li>
                <li> <span class="emphasis"> Node </span> - an element or entry on a tree</li>
                <li> <span class="emphasis">Parent Node </span> a node that is one level 'higher' (towards the top) than a child node, connecting </li>
                <li> <span class="emphasis">Child Node </span>- an entry branching from a parent, one level 'deeper' in the tree -- think of the tree as growing <em> downward </em> such that the children are closer to the bottom of the structure</li>
                <li> <span class="emphasis">Leaf</span> - nodes without children</li>
                <li> <span class="emphasis">Branch</span> - the edges connecting nodes together</li>
            </ol>
        </p>

        <p> Now we're ready to answer what's on our minds, 'What exactly <em> is </em> the DOM?' ... it's a tree! </p>
        <p> We're going to learn about the DOM together on the board, but for your reference later (and as a strong recommendation), read <a href="http://eloquentjavascript.net/13_dom.html"> this EXCELLENT article </a> all about the DOM. It's clear, informative,
            and will catch you up to speed with everything you'll need to know to get started. </p>
        <p> Let's follow <a href="http://www.elated.com/articles/javascript-retrieving-page-elements-via-the-dom/"> this article </a> and <a href="http://www.elated.com/articles/looking-inside-dom-page-elements/"> this </a> article in our Scratchpad to access
            different elements of the DOM via javaScript </p>

        <div class="subtitle"> Let's turn your webpage into a DOM! </div>
        <p> Now we're going to turn your webpage into a graphical 'tree' model using the DOM. For this exercise we're going to use some good ole fashion pen and paper (gasp). We'll do an exmaple together on the board to get you started.

            <p> Here's a lecture slide from <em>CS61A: 'The Structure & Interpretation of Computer Programs'</em> of the tree for your reference:

            </p>
        </p>
        <div class="subtitle"> More Practice with the DOM </div>
        <p> If you're still a little fuzzy with all this DOM stuff, watch this great <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/html-css-js/html-js-dom-access/p/finding-elements-by-id"> Kahn Academy Tutorial on 'DOM Access Methods'  </a>            and try to follow along in your terminal. The whole thing will take 30-45 minutes, but is definitely worth the time to really get you comfortable with javaScript.</p>

        <br/>

        <div class="exercise"> IV. javaScript Basics </div>
        <div class="subtitle"> Your first program </div>
        <p> For this program, we're going to learn a real nifty tool that comes with most web browsers: Scratchpad. So that we're on the same page, I'm going to be talking about Scratchpad in Chrome, which you can <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Scratchpad">download for free </a>            as an extension. Scratchpad is a JavaScript tool that allows you to write and run code that interacts with your window. </p>


        <ol>
            <li> Once you've downloaded Scratchpad, open up Chrome and navigate to your favorite site. </li>
            <li> On the top-right hand corner of the browser, click the symbol with the three horizontal lines: </li>
            <img width="400px" height="300px" src="../images/three_line_symbol.png" />
            <li> Click 'More Tools' >> 'Developer Tools' like so:</li>
            <img width="400px" height="300px" src="../images/developer_tools.png" />
            <li> Click the double right-arrow symbol: '>>' and select "Scratch JS". Your screen should look something like this:</li>
            <img width="400px" height="300px" src="../images/scratch_js.png">
            <li> Now let's write your first program! We'll disect each part of the code below, but for now just copy and paste it into your browser:</li>
            <img width="400px" height="300px" src="../images/scratch_code.png">
            <li> Click "Run" at the bottom right hand of the Scratchpad. </li>

        </ol>
        Cool, right?!
        <div class="subtitle"> Using conditionals</div>
        <p> We know that javaScript can do basic math and represent data as Strings. Now let's learn about <span class="emphasis"> boolean logic </span> </p>
        <p> Introducing the 'if/else' statement </p>
        <p> Let's write an if/else program in Scratchpad:
            <pre class="output"> &lt <span class="input"> if ("myName".length >= 5){ console.log("You have a long name!");} </span> </pre>

            <p> NOTE: Now we're writing to the console, which is a window that logs info about the current web page, including errors in your code, warnings, network information, etc. Click "Run" on Scratchpad, then move over to the "Console" tab to see if
                your message was printed </p>
            <div class="checkoff"> Pro Tip: The method console.log("stuff") is equivalent to the 'print' statement you see in other languages. This is a GREAT way to debug your code if it is not running how you'd expect. The idea is to throw print statements all throughout
                your program and run it. When you hit an error in your code, the browser will just stop running your code entirely. If you have two print statements sandwiching your code, and the first statement printed but the second didn't, you've now
                narrowed down the area of your code that the error is occuring! You can then apply the same strategy to just that area of code (write more print statements and see which ones don't get printed) until you narrow down the error to one or
                two lines. Usually errors occur with simple syntax mistakes, so by then the fix should be more obvious! </div>
            <br/>
            <div class="subtitle"> Building the Foundation </div>
            <p> To really understand what's going on with JS, we're going to run through Mozilla Foundation's <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/JavaScript_basics"> Getting Started with the Web: JavaScript Basics </a>                Tutorial. It has everything you need to know to learn the ABC's of javaScript <em> and </em> other programming languages like Java and Python, which it heavily borrows from. Let's go!</p>
