        <div class="heading">WEEK 5: THE GRID</div>
        <div class="exercise">OVERVIEW</div>
        <p>We're going to talk about perhaps the most important concept in web design and development: LAYOUT! To start, let's read about <a href="http://www.creativebloq.com/netmag/create-balanced-page-layouts-7-pro-tips-121310009"> 7 Pro Tips </a> when
            it comes to layout</p>
        <div class="exercise">LEARNING OBJECTIVES</div>
        <ol>
            <li> Understand the Grid model and practice implementing different box alignment exercises</li>
            <li> Tinker with layouts that you can use for your website</li>
        </ol>

        <div class="exercise">I. Grid By Example</div>
        <p>We're going to look at one of my favorite articles of all time: <a href="http://gridbyexample.com/examples/#example17"> Grid By Example </a>. Seriously. I use this ALL the time -- and so will you! The Grid is magical.</p>

        To appreciate the Grid, let's look at what code <em> used </em> to look like when people had to hack contrived ways to get a proper layout going: And now, drumroll please....the code for Grid: Cool, right? Before we dive into the details, there's
        some things you should know about 'the Grid':
        <ul>
            <li> Pro's
                <ol>
                    <li> It's supported by Chrome and a few other browsers (lookup)</li>
                    <li> It's SUPER easy and convenient to use once you get the hang of it </li>
                    <li> It makes your CSS Style sheet look beautiful and neat </li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li> Con's
                <ol>
                    <li> Many browsers don't use it (lookup)</li>
                    <li> Because they don't support it, you'll have to provide alternatives (we'll get more into the details of this later)</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p> Yes, there's only one real Con -- but it's kinda a big one. If a Browser doesn't support the Grid, all your pretty formatting won't show up to the user, which is bad news bear. The good news is that a lot of browsers are in <em> the process </em>of
            developing support for the Grid since it's so popular and 'up and coming.' Thus it is still really valuable for you to learn and master.
        </p>
        <p> First, create a new file in your Share folder (challenge: can you do this from your terminal?). Make a new "grids_practice.html" file. Open it up and start walking through the exercises from <em> Grid By Example </em> above. If you don't understand
            one, ask for help or skip it for now and come back. </p>
        <div class="checkoff"> Pro Tip: Try not to copy and paste the provided .html and .css files from the website. You'll learn more if you actually type it out. </div>
        <div class="exercise"> II. It's Go Time </div>
        <p> The moment we've all been waiting for: start your website (using the Grid + all other tools we've learned so far)!! By now you should know the spiel: Create a new folder for your website files. In it, create two folders, one for your CSS files,
            the other for your HTML (challenge: terminal). If you have questions, get in the habit of looking them up online -- or ask, that's what we're here for!
