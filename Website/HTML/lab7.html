        <div class="exercise">OVERVIEW</div>
        <p> Today we get to explore the wonderful world of JavaScript. By now your website is looking pretty snazzy. You've got the layout. You've got the style. But perhaps you feel there's something missing....like animation, or a search box, or an interactive
            form/survey, or give users feedback when they interact with your website in a particular way (like <a href="#"> this </a>). That's where JavaScript comes in.
        </p>
        <p> We'll go into the details together, but here's a brief list of how JavaScript can enhance your website:
            <ol>
                <li> Create a sign-up form</li>
                <li> Search box with autocompletion features (brings up suggestions based on what you've typed so far -- typing "de" for instance would signal "desert," "delaware," "dentist")</li>
                <li> Info that changes when you reload the page, like dates, times, sports match results, weather, stock market prices, etc.</li>
                <li> Drop down menu bar </li>
                <li> Organization and modification to the DOM (more on this this later)</li>
                <li> Animate elements on a page (ex: show/hide info, highlight sections, etc.)</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <div class="exercise">LEARNING OBJECTIVES</div>
        <ol>
            <li> Learn what an API is </li>
            <li> Understand how JavaScript works with CSS and HTML</li>
            <li> Incorporate new script in website </li>
        </ol>

        <ul>
            <li>Work on Website Peer feedback: how to give constructive criticism, analysis “Experience psychology” (not just designing for appearance, but also functionality) - navigate through each other’s sites, thinking about the positionality and appearance
                of everything (tool bar, scroll, images, etc.) </li>
            <li>The goal is to receive feedback so that people can 1. See where their teammates are at (and get inspired) </li>
            <li>2. Identify which areas of their site to focus on in the remaining weeks 3. Have a space for analytic dialogue -- this isn’t just a ‘technical’ course devoid of conversation and peer-to-peer interaction;</li>
