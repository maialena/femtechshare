        <div class="exercise">Setup</div>
        <p>In this lab, we’re going to set up our working environment.</p>

        <div class="exercise">I. THE TERMINAL</div>

        <p>This is the interface that you use to directly communicate with the operating system via text-based commands (which are then converted into a language that the computer understands). FOR MAC USERS:
            <ul>
                <li> Lucky for you, all Mac's come with a built-in terminal!</li>
                <li> Simply go to your Spotlight and search "Terminal."</li>
                <li> It should pop right up</li>
            </ul>

            FOR PC USERS:
            <ul>
                <li> fill in instructions</li>
            </ul>

        </p>



        <div class="exercise">II. Exercise 1: </div>
        <p>
            Now that we've got the terminal open, we’re going to learn how to create, move, and organize directories from the command line. First, some important terminology:


            <ul>
                <li>"The command line" - this simply refers to the commands you type into the terminal </li>
                <li>Move into or out of a directory:</li>
                <pre class="output">$ <span class="input"> cd [path/to/file]”:  </span></pre>
                <li>Make a new directory:</li>
                <pre class="output">$ <span class="input"> mkdir [name] </span></pre>
                <li>List the contents of the directory:</li>
                <pre class="output">$ <span class="input">  ls </span></pre>
                <li>Move file from ‘from_path’ to ‘to_path’ if “to_path” exists. If “to_path” does not exist, this changes the name of “from_path” to “to_path” </li>
                <pre class="output">$ <span class="input"> mv [from_path] [to_path]”  </span></pre>


            </ul>

            If these commands don’t make sense right now, it’s okay. We’re going to get some practice by setting up our file system! Where should your website live on your computer? In a folder! Let's create that now.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Open up the Terminal and type “ls.” You should see something like this. The '~' indicates that you are currently in your home directory:</li>

            <img src="../Design/images/terminal.png" style="width: 500px; height: 350px" />

            <li>Now move into your Desktop: </li>
            <pre class="output">$ <span class="input">cd Desktop </span></pre>

            <li>Type “ls.” </li>
            <pre class="output">$ <span class="input"> ls </span></pre>

            <li> You should see all the files on your Desktop.</li>

            <li>Create a new directory: </li>
            <pre class="output">$ <span class="input"> mkdir [myWebsiteName] </span></pre>

            <li>Move into the directory:</li>
            <pre class="output">$ <span class="input"> cd [myWebsiteName] </span></pre>

            <li>Type “ls” -- you should see nothing there. Let’s change that.</li>

            <li>Make your main webpage file</li>:
            <pre class="output">$ <span class="input"> vim index.txt </span></pre>
            <li>This should open up the file. Type something -- anything. To save and exit a file: press 'esc'' then ':wq'. (NOTE: Vim is a text editor that is outside the scope of this workshop, but is very useful to learn if you are interested in programming.
                Check out the main VIM Commands <a href="http://vim.rtorr.com">here </a>to find out more)</li>

            <li>Now let's create some subdirectories for your images, CSS, and javaScript files: </li>
            <pre class="output"> $ <span class="input"> mkdir html </span> </pre>
            <pre class="output"> $ <span class="input"> mkdir styles </span> </pre>
            <pre class="output"> $ <span class="input"> mkdir scripts </span> </pre>
            <pre class="output"> $ <span class="input"> mkdir images </span> </pre>
            <p> Now let's move our index.html file into our html folder </p>
            <pre class="output"> $ <span class="input"> mv index.html html </span> </pre>
            <br/>
            <div class="checkoff">
                NOTE: The language to navigate the terminal is called UNIX. For this course, understanding the command line is not too relevant. If you’re interested in programming beyond this course, however, knowing UNIX is essential. Here's a list of resources to
                help get you started(optional reading):
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="http://mally.stanford.edu/~sr/computing/basic-unix.html"> Basic UNIX Commands </a></li>

                </ul>
            </div>
            <br/>
            <p> You now know enough to create your first (primitive) web page!
                <div class="emphasis">Let's do it.</div>
            </p>
            <li> Open up your index.html file in your textEditor of choice. Copy & paste the code below (we're going to go over this in more detail next lab, so don't worry if the code doesn't make sense yet):</li>
            <pre class="output"><span class="input"> 
                &lt!DOCTYPE html&gt
                    &lthtml&gt
                        &lthead&gt
                            &ltmeta charset="utf-8"&gt
                            &lttitle&gtMy test page&lt/title&gt
                        &lt/head&gt
                        &ltbody&gt
                            &ltimg src="[]" alt="My test image"&gt
                        &lt/body&gt
                    &lt/html&gt        

            </span></pre>
            <br/>
            <li> Now we need to fill in the space between the quotation marks in 'img src="[]" ' with a picture of your choice! Go to Google. Download an image into your Desktop/myWebsite/images directory. Make sure you save it as an '.jpeg' or '.png' Update
                the image source with the <em> path </em> to the image you saved: </li>
            <br/>
            <pre class="output"><span class="input">&ltimg src="../images/myImage.png"/&gt</span></pre>
            <br/>
            <div class="checkoff"> NOTE: To walk from one directory to another, use forward slashes to indicate moving one level in (deeper) from the current subfolder. If you're nestled in a folder and want to move 'out' use two dots like so: "../images/myImage.html". We use
                the two dots here because we're currently in the HTML directory, and our image is in the 'images' directory. So we have to pop out of the HTML directory to then move into (using the forward slash) the images directory</div>
            <br/>
            <li> Final step: Save your file and open it in the browser. Viola! </li>
        </ul>
        <br/>
        <div class="exercise">III. GitHub</div>
        <p>Github is a Version Control System that allows you to save current ‘drafts’ of your working directory (files) to a remote server. Think of it like a backup file system, a way to save drafts as you go. It’s often used in industry by teams, since
            so that people working on a team can edit/update the same collection of files. GitHub is similar to the Cloud in that it acts like a backup system of your current work. It’s similar to Google Docs in that many people can collaborate on one
            project, make drafts, and go back to an earlier version of their work if they want to scrap their edits. Here’s the coolest thing about Version Control systems: multiple people can be working on their own copies of the same file. They do so
            on what’s called ‘branches’ (like a tree -- they all branch off into different directions). When the team decides to go with one person’s version, each team member can ‘merge’ his or her current file with the chosen teammates', so that they're
            once again on the same page.</p>

        <p>That’s a general overview. If you want to learn about GitHub (or Version Control in general), I highly recommend you check out these resources:
            <ol>

            </ol>
        </p>
        <div class="checkoff">
            NOTE: In this course we're not going to learn the intricacies of GitHub. There are many commands like "merge" and "branch" which are useful for collaborating with others on a project. This course is mainly concerned with teaching you web development,
            so the only commands we'll use for GitHub are "add," "status," "commit," and "push" (all necessary for saving the files to the remote repository). If you continue coding beyond this course, you'll likely want to learn the in's and out's of
            GitHub in greater detail.
