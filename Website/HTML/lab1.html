            <div class="exercise">OVERVIEW</div>
            <p>Welcome to FemTECH Share! The purpose of this series is to teach you the basics of HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript so that you can build your own website in just 10 weeks. If you've wanted to learn programming but didn't know where to start, this
                is a great jumping off point into the world of web development. We'll begin each week by sharing a cool video, article, or 'hot topic' in the tech world -- something to get inspired by. We'll likely open the floor up to a brief discussion
                and check-in, and then dive straight into the lab.</p>
            <p> In the beginning, the labs will be made up of equal parts instruction and self-paced exercises. As we progress throughout the semester, however, instruction time will decrease and self-paced-learning time will increase. By the end, you'll
                be leading yourself (and each other) as you learn new tricks and choose the projects that most interest you. </p>
            <p> While you'll pick up programming skills by the end of this series, that's certaintly not the sole purpose. Beyond the technical know-how, we also hope you'll leave with more confidence, research skills, and support to dive as deep into the
                world of web development (and programming) as you'd like after the semester is through.</p>

            <p> But before we jump in, let's answer a basic question that's at the core of anything web-related: what exactly is the internet? Though you don't need to understand what the internet is to develop a website, let alone use one, you'll have way
                more street cred if you do ;) So let's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dxcc6ycZ73M "> watch</a> this awesome video to get oriented. </p>

            <p> Now onto the meat and potatoes: setting up our work environment.</p>

            <div class="exercise">LEARNING OBJECTIVES</div>
            <p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Navigate directories from the command line</li>
                    <li>Understand GitHub & set up work environment</li>
                    <li>Sign up for EdX "HTML, CSS, javaScript online course" (free)</li>
                </ol>
            </p>


            <div class="exercise"> II. Environment Set-Up </div>
            <p> We're going to create all the subdirectories we will need to build a website. There are a few conventions that website developers use, so we'll start by learning them.</p>
            <ul>
                <li> First, open your terminal and <span class="code"> $ cd </span> into your main directory </li>
                <li> Let's create some folders! We'll need a <span class="code"> HTML, CSS, images, </span> & <span class="code"> JS </span> (javaScript) directories for now. Do you remember the UNIX command for making directories? </li>
                <li> In your <span class="emphasis"> root directory </span> (the one that contains all sub-directories), make a new <span class="code"> index.html </span> file </li>
                <li> <span class="code"> $ cd </span> into your CSS directory, and make a new <span class="code"> style.html </span> file </li>
            </ul>
            <p> Why are the main files called "index.html" and "style.css"? No particular reason. It's just the convention that Web Developers use. </p>
            <p> Now we're ready to code! </p>
            <ul>
                <li> Open up VisualStudioCode text editor. <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/c?utm_expid=101350005-27.GqBWbOBuSRqlazQC_nNSRg.2&utm_referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F"> Download it here </a> if you don't have it set up yet.</li>
                <li> We'll walk through the basics of a markup page together on the board in class. If you miss class, or want a refresher later on, use <a href="https://www.sitepoint.com/a-basic-html5-template/">this resource </a>to get started. </a>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <br/>

            <div class="exercise ">III. HTML Doc</div>
            <p> HTML is the language we use to provide structure to our web pages. If you think of a word document, it's all the different parts of the page that make up its form: header, footer, title, subtitles, main text (or 'body' in HTML), paragraphs,
                etc.) The font, text color, background color, and text size is all <em> styling </em> which is left to CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). We'll leave CSS to next week, but for now let's look at the basic building blocks of our HTML doc </p>
            <p> To do so, we're going to go through Chapters 1-5 pages 12-94 from <a href="http://www.wufai.edu.tw/information_technology_center/datasheet/HTML%20and%20CSS%20design%20and%20build%20websites.pdf ">Jon Ducket's HTML & CSS: Design and Build Websites </a>                (don't worry -- they're mostly pictures). Create a lab1.html file in your HTML directory, open up your text editor, and follow along as we play with HTML syntax.</p>


            <div class="exercise">IV. (OPTIONAL) Homework </div>
            <p>Last but not least, we’re going to be using the FREE online course: “HTML5 Introduction.” This is a great introduction to the material we’ll be covering this term. It will be really helpful if you try to complete one section per week so that
                you can come to Share with questions.
                <ol>
                    <li>Sign up for the course <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/html5-introduction-w3cx-html5-0x-0"> here </a> </li>
                    <li> Once you're signed up, you can start the first week's, EdX Module 1: “Creating Web Pages using Hypertext Markup Language (HTML).”</li>
                    <li> Another optional assignment: next week we're going to start designing our websites. You can get a head start with <a href="http://www.designbombs.com/"> designbombs.com </a> to read up on things to think about when choosing colors,
                        fonts, styles (and more) for your website</li>
                </ol>
            </p>
        </div>
