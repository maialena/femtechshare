            <div class="exercise">OVERVIEW</div>
            <p>Welcome to FemTECH Share! The purpose of this series is to teach you the basics of HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript so that you can build your own website in just 10 weeks. If you've wanted to learn programming but didn't know where to start, this
                is a great jumping off point into the world of web development. We'll begin each week by sharing a cool video, article, or 'hot topic' in the tech world -- something to get inspired by. We'll likely open the floor up to a brief discussion
                and check-in, and then dive straight into the lab.</p>
            <p> In the beginning, the labs will be made up of equal parts instruction and self-paced exercises. As we progress throughout the semester, however, instruction time will decrease and self-paced-learning time will increase. By the end, you'll
                be leading yourself (and each other) as you learn new tricks and choose the projects that most interest you. </p>
            <p> While you'll pick up programming skills by the end of this series, that's certaintly not the sole purpose. Beyond the technical know-how, we also hope you'll leave with more confidence, research skills, and support to dive as deep into the
                world of web development (and programming) as you'd like after the semester is through.</p>

            <p> But before we jump in, let's answer a basic question that's at the core of anything web-related: what exactly is the internet? Though you don't need to understand what the internet is to develop a website, let alone use one, you'll have way
                more street cred if you do ;) So let's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dxcc6ycZ73M "> watch</a> this awesome video to get oriented. </p>

            <p> Now onto the meat and potatoes: setting up our work environment.</p>

            <div class="exercise">LEARNING OBJECTIVES</div>
            <p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Navigate directories from the command line</li>
                    <li>Understand GitHub & set up work environment</li>
                    <li>Sign up for EdX "HTML, CSS, javaScript online course" (free)</li>
                </ol>
            </p>

            <div class="exercise">I. The Terminal</div>

            <p>This is the interface that you use to directly communicate with the operating system via text-based commands (which are then converted into a language that the computer understands). Other names for the 'terminal' include:
                <ol>
                    <li> Shell </li>
                    <li> Console </li>
                    <li> Command line </li>
                    <li> Command prompt </li>
                </ol>
            </p>
            <p>
                To get started, simply search for "Terminal" (probably in your 'Applications'). If you'd like to read more about the terminal, check out the Ubuntu documentation <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UsingTheTerminal"> here </a>

            </p>
            <p>
                Now that we've got the terminal open, we’re going to learn how to create, move, and organize directories from the command line. First, some important commands:

            </p>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Move into or out of a directory:</li>
                    <pre class="output">$ <span class="input"> cd [path/to/file]”:  </span></pre>
                    <br/>
                    <li>Make a new directory:</li>
                    <pre class="output">$ <span class="input"> mkdir [name] </span></pre>
                    <br/>
                    <li>List the contents of the directory:</li>
                    <pre class="output">$ <span class="input">  ls </span></pre>
                    <br/>
                    <li>Move file from ‘from_path’ to ‘to_path’ if “to_path” exists. If “to_path” does not exist, this changes the name of “from_path” to “to_path” </li>
                    <pre class="output">$ <span class="input"> mv [from_path] [to_path]”  </span></pre>


                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>

                If these commands don’t make sense right now, it’s okay. We’re going to get some practice using the command line below.
            </p>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Open up the Terminal and type “ls.” You should see something like this. The '~' indicates that you are currently in your home directory:</li>

                    <img src="../images/terminal.png" style="width: 500px; height: 350px" />

                    <li>Now move into your Desktop: </li>
                    <pre class="output">$ <span class="input">cd Desktop </span></pre>
                    <br/>

                    <li>Type “ls.” </li>
                    <pre class="output">$ <span class="input"> ls </span></pre>
                    <br/>

                    <li> You should see all the files on your Desktop.</li>

                    <li>Create a new directory: </li>
                    <pre class="output">$ <span class="input"> mkdir [name] </span></pre>
                    <br/>

                    <li>Move into the directory:</li>
                    <pre class="output">$ <span class="input"> cd [name] </span></pre>
                    <br/>

                    <li>Type “ls” -- you should see nothing there. Let’s change that.</li>
                    <br/>
                    <li>Make a new file:</li>
                    <pre class="output">$ <span class="input"> vim [name].txt </span></pre>
                    <br/>
                    <li>This should open up the file. Type something -- anything. To save and exit a file: press esc --> wq. (NOTE: Vim is a text editor built into your terminal that we won't explicitly teach in this workshop, but is very useful to learn
                        if you are interested in programming. Check out the main VIM Commands <a href="http://vim.rtorr.com">here </a>to find out more)</li>

                    <br/>
                    <li>Last but not least, change the name of your file to “fem_tech_lab1” using the “mv” command. Try this out on your own --talk with the person next to you if you get stuck. </li>

                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                <div class="checkoff">
                    NOTE: The language to navigate the terminal is called UNIX. For this course, understanding the command line is not too relevant. If you’re interested in programming beyond this course, however, knowing UNIX is essential. Here's a list of resources to
                    help get you started(optional reading):
                    <ol>
                        <li><a href="http://mally.stanford.edu/~sr/computing/basic-unix.html"> Basic UNIX Commands </a></li>
                        <li><a href=" https://www.codecademy.com/ru/courses/learn-the-command-line/lessons/navigation/exercises/your-first-command?action=resume">Code Academy Learn the Command Line</a></li>
                    </ol>
                </div>
            </p>


            <div class="exercise"> II. Environment Set-Up </div>
            <p> We're going to create all the subdirectories we will need to build a website. There are a few conventions that website developers use, so we'll start by learning them.</p>
            <ul>
                <li> First, open your terminal and <span class="code"> $ cd </span> into your main directory </li>
                <li> Let's create some folders! We'll need a <span class="code"> HTML, CSS, images, </span> & <span class="code"> JS </span> (javaScript) directories for now. Do you remember the UNIX command for making directories? </li>
                <li> In your <span class="emphasis"> root directory </span> (the one that contains all sub-directories), make a new <span class="code"> index.html </span> file </li>
                <li> <span class="code"> $ cd </span> into your CSS directory, and make a new <span class="code"> style.html </span> file </li>
            </ul>
            <p> Why are the main files called "index.html" and "style.css"? No particular reason. It's just the convention that Web Developers use. </p>
            <p> Now we're ready to code! </p>
            <ul>
                <li> Open up VisualStudioCode text editor. <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/c?utm_expid=101350005-27.GqBWbOBuSRqlazQC_nNSRg.2&utm_referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F"> Download it here </a> if you don't have it set up yet.</li>
                <li> We'll walk through the basics of a markup page together on the board in class. If you miss class, or want a refresher later on, use <a href="https://www.sitepoint.com/a-basic-html5-template/">this resource </a>to get started. </a>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <br/>

            <div class="exercise">III. GitHub</div>
            <p>Github is a <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/what-is-version-control">Version Control System </a> that allows you to save drafts as you go to remote server. Think of it as a backup file system, like the Cloud, or even better,
                as a tool that's analogous to the "Save As" option in Word. By recording all your changes as you go, you can always go back to earlier versions of your code if you want to scrap recent edits.
            </p>
            <p> Github is used in industry by teams, so that people working on the same project can edit local versions of the code without overriding each other's work. Team members can work separately on their own local copies of the code, or they can merge
                together their work so that everyone is on the same page. </p>

            <p>If you want to learn more about GitHub (or Version Control in general), I highly recommend you check out these resources:
                <ol>
                    <li class="resources"><a href="http://stephaniehoh.github.io/blog/2013/10/07/git-vs-github-for-dummies/">Git VS Github </a></li>
                    <li class="resources"><a href="http://skillcrush.com/2013/02/11/version-control/"> Version Control 101 </a></li>
                    <li class="resources"><a href="https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver/basic-git-commands-776639767.html">Basic GIT Commands</a> </li>
                </ol>
            </p>
            <div class="checkoff">
                NOTE: In this course we're not going to learn the intricacies of GitHub. There are many commands like "merge" and "branch" which are useful for collaborating with others on a project. This course is mainly concerned with teaching you web development,
                so the only commands we'll use for GitHub are "add," "status," "commit," and "push" (all necessary for saving the files to the remote repository). If you continue coding beyond this course, you'll likely want to learn the in's and out's
                of GitHub, and the above tutorials are a great place to start.
            </div>


            <p> It's time to make an account. Github has an awesome deal for students: an unlimited number of <span class="emphasis"> free </span> repositories (folders) for projects. Get the pack <a href="https://education.github.com/"> here. </a></p>
            <p> Time to make your first repository.
                <ol>
                    <li>Create a repository (private or public, it's up to you -- you can change the status at any time) called “FEMTechShare”</li>
                    <li> Open your terminal and navigate to the directory you made for FemTech.</li>
                    <li> Initialize Git. This command is used to create an empty Git repository. It creates a .git folder that allows you to start recording revisions of your files.</li>
                    <pre class="output">$ <span class="input"> git init </span></pre>
                    <br/>
                    <li> Test that the .git folder is in your directory with the "ls" command </li>
                    <li> Open your repository on GitHub and click the "Clone or download" button to left. Copy the code </li>
                    <li> From the terminal, type the following to connect your local repo with your Git repo:</li>
                    <pre class="output">$ <span class="input"> git clone [paste url] </span></pre>
                    <br/>
                    <li> Double check that you've cloned your remote repo correctly </li>
                    <pre class="output">$ <span class="input"> git remote -v  </span></pre>
                    <br/>
                    <li> You should see something like this </li>
                    <img height="100px" width="700px" src="../images/git_clone_repo.png" />
                    <li> Tada! That's it.</li>
                </ol>
            </p>
            <p> Finally, let's learn the basic commands with <a href="https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1">another tutorial</a> </p>
