        <p>What's an API? It stands for "Application Programming Interface." Think of API's' as the 'messengers of the internet' that allow you to communicate with applications. Say you want to embed a Google Map into your website (what we'll do today).
            Well, you have to send a request to the Geolocation API (made up of precise specifications for how programmers can use the service). The API accepts the request, and if the request is valid, it provides the given data (in this case, a location
            on a map). </p>
        <p>Another popular API example: say you want to access data about the number of Twitter posts you receive on your company website. You can't just ask the folks at Twitter to give you the info any time you want. Instead, the API handles that by pulling
            that info from Twitter's database. </p>
        <p>If you're still confused, check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7wmiS2mSXY"> this </a>Youtube clip (it uses a waiter analogy that may be helpful) to explain an API. </p>

        <p> NOTE: Sifting through tons of online forums, blogs, and educational sites can be frustrating at times. It's easy to lose patience, and even feel discouraged when you can't find exactly what you're looking for. But don't fret. It might seem like
            you've 'wasted time' spending hours on a seemingly small task, but
            <span class="emphasis"> all </span> that work is actually really useful. Think of it as exercise. You're training your search-engine muscles to pull useful information from technical articles. You'll become faster at this over time, so be
            patient with yourself and the learning process.</p>
        <div class="checkoff"> Pro Tip: If you get an error message, try copying and pasting the exact error into the search engine. See what comes up </div>
