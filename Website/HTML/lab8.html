            <p> Today you're going to teach yourself by walking through online tutorials of things you want to learn. I've provided links to a few tutorials below. All are great places to start if you're at a loss for a project. If you have ideas for what
                you'd rather do (say embed a Google map into your site with the Geolocation API, or include a dropdown menu), feel free to start there. Pair up with a partner or form small groups if you prefer that to working alone. If you come across
                great sites, share them! </p>
            <p> Because there are so many forums, tutorials, and explanations online, it may be hard to know where to start. The easiest way is to just to start Googling exactly what you want to learn, and refine your search results if you don't find what
                you're looking for. Alternatively, you can run through one or more of the interactive projects in the exercises below, or check out Code Academy's <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/projects"> Web Projects </a></li>. You can
                also read <a href="http://www.creativebloq.com/web-design/examples-of-javascript-1233964"> this </a> article on the "Top 20 Examples of JavaScript" in action for inspiration. <a href="https://css-tricks.com/"> CSS-Tricks </a> is also one
                of my favorite blogs for learning cool new web-y tricks. Despite its name, this site is much more than CSS. Check it out.</p>

            <p> Before we jump right in, we're going to finish up learning about more advanced JS data types, as well as answer the question, "What is an API and how do I use one?" </p>
            <div class="exercise">LEARNING OBJECTIVES</div>
            <ol>
                <li> Get hands-on experience building something cool with javaScript </li>
                <li> Learn what API's are and how to use them </li>
                <li> Learn more advanced JS Data Types </li>
            </ol>

            </ol>

            <div class="subtitle"> API's </div>
            <p>What's an API? It stands for "Application Programming Interface." Think of API's' as the 'messengers of the internet' that allow you to communicate with applications. Say you want to embed a Google Map into your website (what we'll do today).
                Well, you have to send a request to the Geolocation API (made up of precise specifications for how programmers can use the service). The API accepts the request, and if the request is valid, it provides the given data (in this case, a
                location on a map). </p>
            <p>Another popular API example: say you want to access data about the number of Twitter posts you receive on your company website. You can't just ask the folks at Twitter to give you the info any time you want. Instead, the API handles that by
                pulling that info from Twitter's database. </p>
            <p>If you're still confused, check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7wmiS2mSXY"> this </a>Youtube clip (it uses a waiter analogy that may be helpful) to explain an API. </p>

            <p> <span class="checkoff"> NOTE: Sifting through tons of online forums, blogs, and educational sites can be frustrating at times. It's easy to lose patience, and even feel discouraged when you can't find exactly what you're looking for. But don't fret. It might seem
                like you've 'wasted time' spending hours on a seemingly small task, but
                <span class="emphasis"> all </span> that work is actually really useful. Think of it as exercise. You're training your search-engine muscles to pull useful information from technical articles. You'll become faster at this over time, so
                be patient with yourself and the learning process.</span>
            </p>


            <div class="exercise">I. Random Number Generator </div>
            <p> We'll do this exercise together in our text editor because it incorporates many of the fundamentals we've covered in the last few weeks. If you miss class, you can run through the exercise on your own <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/A_first_splash"> here. </a>                </p>
            <p> The remaining exercises are all optional. You'll spend the rest of class researching and implementing whatever you like in HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript. If you don't understand a tutorial, don't simply copy and paste the code and call it a day.
                Ask for help and make sure you really understand what's going on. When you're done, try teaching it to someone who's working on something else. </p>
            <div class="exercise">II. Photo Gallery </div>
            <p> Walk through <a href="http://html-tuts.com/html-photo-gallery-simple-javascript/">this </a>tutorial </p>
            <div class="exercise">III. To-Do List </div>
            <p> Walk through <a href="http://code-maven.com/todo-in-html-and-javascript"> this </a> or <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_todolist.asp"> this </a>tutorial. Read over the code and try to understand what every line is doing. The
                point is not to memorize it but to realize that every line has a purpose, and figure out the sequence of steps necessary to build the to-do list. Treat the code like a story, with a beginning, middle, and end. Would you be able to retell
                the story if a friend asked you how you built the list? Once you're comfortable with the code, minimize the browser and try building the to-do list on your own. If you get stuck, try a few things out before looking back at the solution.
