            <div class="exercise">OVERVIEW</div>
            <p>Today we're going to dive deeper into the world of <span class="emphasis">CSS. </span> </p>
            <p> We'll start with our weekly Internet update, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYdF7b3nMto&index=4&list=PLzdnOPI1iJNfMRZm5DDxco3UdsFegvuB7"> Packets, Routing, and Reliability </a></p>

            <div class="exercise">LEARNING OBJECTIVES</div>
            <ol>
                <li> Understand the difference between CSS and HTML </li>
                <li> Learn basic CSS Syntax </li>
                <li> Start using stylesheets in your webpage!</li>
            </ol>
            <div class="exercise"> I. CSS Syntax </div>
            <p> First we're going to do some reading from the experts. Grab a partner and read <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Learn/CSS/Introduction_to_CSS/Syntax"> this article </a> together. Stop periodically to discuss what you just read,
                and take notes. Or even better, open up your terminal and practice by trying out what you read in a new "lab4.html" and "lab4.css" file. Ask questions if things are confusing. </p>
            <div class="checkoff"> NOTE: If you finish early, or simply want to learn more, check out <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Learn/CSS/Introduction_to_CSS/Selectors/Simple_selectors"> CSS Simple Selectors </a></div>
            <br/>
            <div class="exercise"> II. MeSS with cSS </div>
            <p> We're going to learn about the super cool <span class="emphasis"> INSPECT </span> tool available in many web browsers (for this exercise, it's best to use Chrome if you can).
                <ol>
                    <li>Step 1: Partner Up. </li>
                    <li>Step 2: Open <a href="https://zapier.com/blog/inspect-element-tutorial/"> this </a> tutorial to get started. You can skim (or skip) over the first part, and start reading at the section entitled 'Change Anything With Elements.' </li>
                    <li>Step 3: Follow along with the Tutorial! Ask questions (first to the people around you) if you get stuck. </li>
                </ol>
            </p>

            <div class="exercise"> III. Find The CSS From Within </div>
            <p>Now that it's Week 4 it's time for some reflection. We want you to appreciate HOW MUCH you've learned in such a short amount of time. Seriously -- it might not look like a lot, but HTML & CSS are the backbone of almost every website out there.
                So if you can get these languages down, you're well on your way to being an amazing front end web developer! To show you the power of CSS, we're going to follow along the <span class="emphasis"> CSS Zen Garden</span> exercise. Create a
                new subdirectory in your Share folder (<span class="emphasis">challenge:</span> can you do this from your terminal?) and download the index.html & style.css files from the website.</p>
            <p> Partner up and look through both files. First make sure you have a general sense of what's going on -- if you don't, talk through what you <em> think </em> the elements you're unsure about do.</p>
            <p> Then test it out! Play with the CSS files and log your findings by writing comments next to the elements you've learned about. Use '/* */' to write comments like so:
                <pre class="output"><span class="input"> /* This is a comment. The processor will not render it as code */ </span></pre>
                <br/> If you really want to be the above-and-beyond-student, open up a TextEditor and log all the new things you've learned so that you can use it for reference later.
            </p>
            <p> We'll mess with the css for 20 minutes or so and then come to the board with our findings and any lingering questions.</p>

            <div class="exercise"> IV. Online Business Card Challenge </div>
            <p>To test all your newfound knowledge, we'll be completing Mozilla's' <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Learn/CSS/Introduction_to_CSS/Fundamental_CSS_comprehension">CSS coding challenge </a>. This is going to be a solo project, but
                feel free to ask questions -- we're here to help!</p>
            <div class="exercise"> Homework: </div>
