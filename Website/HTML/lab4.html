        <div class="exercise">OVERVIEW</div>
        Today we're going to learn about <span class="emphasis">CSS </span>


        <p><span class="question">'What is CSS??'</span></p>

        <p><em>Here's how <span class="emphasis">edX </span>defines it. </em>
            <p>'Cascading Syle Sheets (CSS) is a language that controls and allows one to define the look of an HTML document. It permits the separation between the content of the HTML document from the style of the HTML file. CSS enables one to specify
                things such as the font you want on your page, the size of your text, the columns of the page, whether the text on a page is to be in bold or italics, background, link colors, margins, and placement of objects on a page and so on. By way
                of explanation, it is the part that controls the looks of a web page. With CSS, it is much easier to manage the appearance of multiple web pages since it separates the HTML element from display information. CSS also enables faster downloading
                of web pages, which works best with older computers and modems. It provides a method for retaining a common style.'</p>

        <div class="exercise">LEARNING OBJECTIVES</div>
        <ol>
            <li> Understand the difference between CSS and HTML </li>
            <li> Learn basic CSS Syntax </li>
            <li> Start using stylesheets in your webpage!</li>
        </ol>
        <div class="exercise"> CSS Syntax </div>
        <p> First we're going to do some reading from the experts. Grab a partner and read <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Learn/CSS/Introduction_to_CSS/Syntax"> this article </a> together. Stop periodically to discuss what you just read. Try
            to paraphrase it without regurgitating the info exactly. Ask questions if things are confusing. </p>
        <p> Let's also check out <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Learn/CSS/Introduction_to_CSS/Selectors/Simple_selectors"> what simple selectors are all about </a></p>

        <div class="exercise"> II. MeSS with cSS </div>
        <p> We're going to learn about the super cool <span class="emphasis"> INSPECT </span> tool available in many web browsers (for this exercise, it's best to use Chrome if you can).
            <ul>
                <li>Step 1: Partner Up. </li>
                <li>Step 2: Open <a href="https://zapier.com/blog/inspect-element-tutorial/"> this </a> tutorial to get started. You can skim (or skip) over the first part, and start reading at the section entitled 'Change Anything With Elements.' </li>
                <li> Step 3: Follow along with the Tutorial! Ask questions (first to the people around you) if you get stuck. </li>
            </ul>

        <div class="exercise"> III. Find The CSS From Within </div>
        <p>Now that it's Week 4 it's time for some reflection. We want you to appreciate HOW MUCH you've learned in such a short amount of time. Seriously -- it might not look like a lot, but HTML & CSS are the backbone of almost every website out there.
            So if you can get these languages down, you're well on your way to being an amazing front end web developer! To show you the power of CSS, we're going to follow along the <span class="emphasis"> CSS Zen Garden</span> exercise. Create a new
            subdirectory in your Share folder (<span class="emphasis">challenge:</span> can you do this from your terminal?) and download the index.html & style.css files from the website.</p>
        <p> Partner up and look through both files. First make sure you have a general sense of what's going on -- if you don't, talk through what you <em> think </em> the elements you're unsure about do.</p>
        <p> Then test it out! Play with the CSS files and log your findings by writing comments next to the elements you've learned about. Use '/* */' to write comments like so:
            <pre class="output"><span class="input"> /* This is a comment. The processor will not render it as code */ </span></pre>
            <br/> If you really want to be the above-and-beyond-student, open up a TextEditor and log all the new things you've learned so that you can use it for reference later.
        </p>
        <p> We'll mess with the css for 20 minutes or so and then come to the board with our findings and any lingering questions.</p>

        <div class="exercise"> IV. Online Business Card Challenge </div>
        To test all your newfound knowledge, we'll be completing Mozilla's' <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Learn/CSS/Introduction_to_CSS/Fundamental_CSS_comprehension">CSS coding challenge </a>. This is going to be a solo project, but feel free
        to ask questions -- we're here to help! </div>
