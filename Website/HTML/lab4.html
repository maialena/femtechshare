            <div class="exercise">OVERVIEW</div>
            Alas, the moment we've been waiting for:
            <center>
                <div id="workshop"> WORKSHOP DAY!!! </div>
            </center> <br/> So far I've thrown a lot of syntax and information at you -- time to put it together. We'll spend today working on our basic portfolio page. To give you a starting point, check out the example example.html and example.css files I've
            made <a href="/Users/maialena/ExampleWebsite/"> here </a>. Go into the correct subdirectory (either html or css), click on the file, and use the Inspect Tool (right click on the page) to see the html and css. We're going to break up into mini-pods
            today, so please please get to know the people around you and ask each other questions. Here's the workflow I want you guys to try out:
            <ol>
                <li> Review slides from Labs 2-3 and your notes if you're completely lost to get an idea of where to start </li>
                <li> Ask a neighbor for help (also learn their name) </li>
                <li> Look at the example html and css files provided. Read them first, then <em> close them </em> before you start writing up your doc. See if you can replicate the correct syntax and elements from memory. You'll thank yourself later if you
                    do.
                </li>
                <li> Flag down one of the mentors walking around for help/explanation of what's going on, or consult Google.</li>
            </ol>

            <p> Below I've provided a host of tutorials for you to look at today and in the future. Some will take 5 minutes, some an hour or so, depending on how comfortable you feel with HTML/CSS. Feel free to work on your own project as well (simply look
                up 'how to make a [ ] in [css or html]' online, and follow along).
            </p>
            <div class="checkoff"> Word of Advice: Please, please do not just open up the example.html and example.css files and copy and paste. Of course no one is stopping you from doing that, but it's only going to hurt you in the longrun since you won't learn the syntax
                as well as if you struggle with it first. </div>

                assignment, or a chore. Treat it like you're finally getting to play with that cool new toy you got for Christmas. Remember, ask for help if you get stuck. </p>

            <div class="exercise"> III. Navigation Bar </div>
            <p> Later in this course we'll update our navigation bars by making them mobile responsive (meaning they shrink or grow as you change the size of the window, say for an iPhone versus a Desktop). We'll also add a bit of javaScript so you can make
                a drop-down window and 'toggle' things on and off with a mouse click. For now, we'll focus on making our navigation bar's look good.

            <p> Exercises IV-V below are intended to show you how powerful HTML5 is on its own. Sure, CSS adds style to the page and javaScript adds interactivity. But even without those languages, you can have a fully functioning website with HTML alone.
            </p>

            <div class="exercise">IV. Stayin' Alive With HTML5</div>

            <div class="checkoff"> Pro Tip: Here's a list of go-to websites to consult when you have a programming question, want to implement something new for the first time, or need help debugging.
                <ol>
                    <li> <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/">Mozilla Developer Network </a> -- the official website for development and documentation of web standards for CSS, HTML, and JavaScript </li>
                    <li> <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/"> Stack Overflow </a> -- a Q & A site for programmers </li>
                    <li> <a href="https://css-tricks.com/"> CSS-Tricks </a> -- despite its name, this is site about all things web-related, not just CSS. It includes blog posts, video tutorials, and an active forum </li>
                    <li> <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/"> W3Schools </a> -- great compilation of tutorials, examples, and references for web development.</li>
                </ol>
            </div>
            <br/>


            <div class="exercise"> V. Video in HTML5</div>
            <p>
                If you want to feature a video from YouTube or some video hosting site, you can easily do so by embedding it. Nowadays, many sites make this easy. You can often right-click on the video, choose "Copy embed code" and paste it into your html doc. What's
                copied is something like this: &ltiframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/J---aiyznGQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt&lt/iframe&gt
            </p>
            <p> Simply adjust the width and height attributes to the appropriate size, and you're done. 'Frameborder' is a boolean attribute (meaning it has two values, "on" or "of") that indicate whether or not you want to have a border. 0 is "off", 1 is
                "yes."
            </p>
            <p> Say you have a .mp4 or .ogv file on your computer (say something you've filmed yourself, or an animated clip you've made with Flash) that you want to include on your website. Again, the easiest way to do so is to host the video through a site
                like Youtube and embed it on your site as above. The upside is that video hosting sites will automatically convert your video into the various formats required by browsers. The downside of that is if you want your video to play exclusively
                on your website. If that's the case, you'll have to host it, which takes a few more steps </p>
            <p> The main consideration when hosting your own video is including all the various formats supported by different browsers, including AVI, Flash, MPEG, Quicktime, and more. Fortunately, HTML5 (which unfortunately is not supported by all browsers)
                makes this easy with its &ltvideo&gt element. If you're interested in using HTML5 to embed video into your page, use the following links (ordered by usefulness) to learn more: </p>

            </ol>
            <div class="exercise"> VI. Audio in HTML5 </div>
            <p> As with video, there are different ways to embed audio into your webpage. The first is through a hosted service like Soundcloud.com that allows you to upload your audio; this route also provides an audio player that you can embed in your page
                - making it really easy. The second method is harder, and relies on Flash. The third is through using HTML5's built-in &ltaudio&gt element. To delve into any of these methods, use the following links:</p>

                learning styles, and part of being a web developer (or programmer in general) is learning to research, research, research until something clicks.</p>
