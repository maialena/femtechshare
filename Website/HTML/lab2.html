        <div class="heading">WEEK#2: MOCKUP, HTML DOC, & Blog</div>
        <div class="exercise">OVERVIEW</div>
        <p>Today we have an assortment of exercises to get you on your way to building your first website. </p>
        <p> First, we want to set up a blog using HubPress. Hub Press is a FREE web platform that links up to your GitHub account and makes it easy to build your blog. Next, we want to create a mockup (ie draft) of the main website page, thinking about color,
            layout, font, and themes. Finally, we'll put it to the test and start coding!
        </p>

        <div class="exercise">LEARNING OBJECTIVES</div>
        <ul>
            <li> Create HubPress Blog page. Begin blogging this week </li>
            <li> Understand basic design thinking. Create mockup of website </li>
            <li> Write first html doc! </li>
        </ul>
        <div class="exercise">I. Start Your Blog</div>
        <p> All you need to do to start your blog is "fork" (ie download) a ready-made repository onto your GitHub account. Let's walk through the steps.</p>
        <ol>
            <li> Watch this Demo <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gP3i4tHlRM"> here </a> (there's no sound, but you'll get the point) </li>
            <li> Now it's time to "fork"! Scroll down to the "Get App" section of <a href="http://hubpress.io">this page </a>and click "fork"</li>
            <li> GitHub will ask where you'd like them to save the HubPress repository. Once saved, scroll down to the "README" doc at the bottom and read about HubPress and how to get it started. It might be a little confusing how to change the <span class="code">hubpress.io/hubress/config.json </span>                file so let's enumerate the steps in closer detail:</li>
            <ol>
                <li> Click on the <span class="code">hubpress.io </span> directory >> <span class="code">Settings </span> >> change the repo name to <span class="code"> gitHubUsername.github.io</span> </li>
                <span class="checkoff"> NOTE: It's important that you set the <span class="code"> gitHubUsername</span> to your <em> actual </em> gitHub username! Don't make a new one up. Alternatively, if you want to change your gitHub Username in addition
                to your GitHug Pages username, you can do <em> both </em> in Settings to make sure they're consistent </span>
                <li> Now for the real fun: modifying a file from your terminal! </li>
                <li> Open your Terminal </li>
                <li> <span class="code"> cd </span> into your working directory </li>
                <pre class="output"> $ <span class="input"> cd ~/Desktop/path/to/femtech/directory </span></pre>
                <li><span class="code"> clone </span> your gitHub repository into the main directory (ask for help if this is unclear by now)</li>
                Now your entire directory should be in your local repository! Double check that this is so with 'ls.''
                <pre class="output"> $ <span class="input"> ls </span></pre> [insert image of all the files]
                <li> Check that your <span class="code"> gitHubUsername.github.io </span> directory is connected to the file </li>
                <pre class="output"> $ <span class="input"> git remote -v </span></pre> You should see something like this [insert image]
                <li> Now you should cd into <span class="code"> gitHubUsername.github.io/hubpress/ </span> directory </li>
                <li> Open the file <span class="code">config.json </span> with the "vim" command. To edit files in VIM, press "i". Use the arrow keys to move around. Change the <span class="code"> username </span> and <span class="code"> repository </span>                    name (as listed on the HubPress README instructions -- if you forget this part, look back there fore reference) </li>
                <li>Once you're done press <span class="code"> esc </span> followed by the keys <span class="code"> ":wq"</span> to save and quit </li>
                <li> Now it's time to commit your changes! Follow these commands: </li>
                <pre class="output"> $ <span class="input"> git add config.json </span> <br/> $ <span class="input"> git status </span> # make sure that your config.json is added to the working directory <br/> $ <span class="input"> git commit -m "Updated config.json file"</span> <br/> $ <span class="input"> git push origin master </span> </pre>                VIOLA!!
                <li> Last but not least, go to <span class="code"> https://gitHubUsername.github.io </span> to check out your blog! </li>

            </ol>

        <div class="exercise">I. COLOR THEORY</div>
        <p>There's no way we can teach all of color theory in one exercise (or course, for that matter). Design is something that takes years of 'being a designer' to learn -- and for many, it comes more intuitively. If you're interested in learning more
            about design theory, there's an AWESOME compilation of design resources to read up on <a href="https://gist.github.com/jenmyers/7354863"> here </a>. For our purposes, we're just going to learn about how to use the basics of color theory</p>
        <p> First, let's get our terminology down. There are three color schemes that we're going to explore: </p>
        <ol>
            <li> <span class="emphasis">Traidic</span> - composed of three colors on separate ends of the color scheme. To find, pick any color on the color wheel and draw an equilateral triangle. These points make up your tri-color scheme.</li>
            <li> <span class="emphasis">Compound </span>- two colors are chosen from opposite ends of the spectrum to form a 'complimentary' scheme </li>
            <li><span class="emphasis"> Analogous </span></li> - careful selection of colors from the same area of the color spectrum, like shades of orange and yellow or 'monochramatic selection' (shades of a base color)
        </ol>
        <p> You can test these color schemes out with <a href="https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel/?base=2&rule=Triad&selected=1&name=My%20Color%20Theme&mode=rgb&rgbvalues=0.7,0.631372549019511,0.06999999999999998,0.09999999999999998,0.8769865841074079,1,1,0.8910675381262081,0,0.8,0.07999999999999999,0.4210196078438275,0.7,0.03500000000000003,0.34996949891131296&swatchOrder=0,1,2,3,4"> Kuler, a super cool design tool made by Adobe </p>
        <p> Other (maybe) useful lingo that you can (if you want but don't have to) look up: hue, saturation, and contrast.</p>
        <div class="checkoff"> Pro Tip: As you're browsing the internet, keep an eye out for these color schemes. The more familiary you have with them, the better your intuition will be when it comes to selecting colors for your website </div>

        <p> Next, we'll learn about color representation in CSS & HTMl. Every color is represented by a <span class="emphasis"> hexadecimal </span> number (ie 6 digits). The first two digits represent shades of red, the second two are green, and the last two are blue.
        Together, you can get all the colors of the rainbow! Take 5 minutes to read <a href="http://skillcrush.com/2012/05/07/hexadecimal/"> this brief explanation </a> of how to break down the hexidecimal colors.</p>

        <p> Finally, here's an alternative way to represent colors. Rather than using a hexadecimal number, we can use HSLa (which stands for Hue, Saturation, Ligtness (& alpha) to represent colors. This is a REALLY wonderful way to find the perfect color
            you're looking for, though it's not as commonly used by developers simply because....well there's no real good reason. People often stick to what they know, so you might not come accross HSLa that often when you read other people's code. But
            if you can get a hang of it, it makes changing colors MUCH easier to do. Read about it <a href="https://css-tricks.com/yay-for-hsla/"> here </a></p>

        <div class="exercise">II. HyperText Markup Language</div>
        <p> We're going to create all the subdirectories we will need to build a website. There are a few conventions that website developers use, so we'll start by learning them.</p>
        <ul>
            <li> First, open your terminal and <span class="code"> $ cd </span> into your main directory </li>
            <li> Let's create some folders! We'll need a <span class="code"> HTML, CSS, images, </span> & <span class="code"> JSS </span> (javaScript) directories for now. Do you remember the UNIX command for making directories? If not, look it up ;) </li>
            <li> <span class="code"> $ cd </span> into your HTML directory, and make a new <span class="code"> index.html </span> file </li>
            <li> <span class="code"> $ cd </span> into your CSS directory, and make a new <span class="code"> style.html </span> file </li>
        </ul>
        <p> Why "index.html" and "style.css"?? No particular reason! It's just the convention that Web Developers use, and it's always best practice to stick with it! </p>
        <p> Now we're ready to code! </p>
        <ul>
            <li> Open up VisualStudioCode text editor (refer to <a href="../lab1.html/">Lab1 </a>if you don't have it set up yet) </li>
            <li> We'll walk through the basics of a markup page together on the board in class. If you miss class, or want a refresher later on, use <a href="https://www.sitepoint.com/a-basic-html5-template/">this resource </a>to get started </a>
            </li>
        </ul>
