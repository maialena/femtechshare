            <div class="exercise">OVERVIEW</div>
            <p> We're going to practice our HTML today and dive into a pair programming challenge focused on CSS. </p>
            <p> To kick us off, let's return to our ongoing exploration of the internet with a video on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o8CwafCxnU&index=3&list=PLzdnOPI1iJNfMRZm5DDxco3UdsFegvuB7"> IP Addresses and DNS </a></p>
            <div class="exercise">LEARNING OBJECTIVES</div>
            <ol>
                <li>Understand the basic building blocks of an HTML5 Doc </li>
                <li> Learn HTML5 Audio, Video, Form, and Geolocation </li>
                <li> Clone a website </li>
                <li> Pair program </li>
            </ol>

            <div class="exercise">I. Stayin' Alive With HTML5</div>
            <p> Exercises II-V are intended to show you how powerful HTML5 is on its own. Sure, CSS adds style to the page and javaScript adds interactivity. But even without those languages, you can have a fully functioning website with HTML alone. </p>
            <p>Don't worry about completing all these exercisees today. Choose one or two to focus on, grab a partner (or work alone), and use the tutorials as <em> starting points. </em> If you come accross something you're confused about, I encourage you
                to continue Google searching until you find an answer. Of course if you're really stuck, ask for help. Though you're not expected to do all these exercises in lab today, I encourage you to try them out when you have the time.</p>
            <div class="checkoff"> Pro Tip: Here's a list of go-to websites to consult when you have a programming question, want to implement something new for the first time, or need help debugging</p>
                <ol>
                    <li> <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/">Mozilla Developer Network </a> -- the official website for development and documentation of web standards for CSS, HTML, and JavaScript </li>
                    <li> <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/"> Stack Overflow </a> -- a Q & A site for programmers </li>
                    <li> <a href="https://css-tricks.com/"> CSS-Tricks </a> -- despite its name, this is site about all things web-related, not just CSS. It includes blog posts, video tutorials, and an active forum </li>
                </ol>
            </div>
            <br/>
            <p>Let's put those search-engine skills to practice. Choose one or two(or all) of the exercises below, and use the links provided as <em> starting </em> points. This is the fun and challenging part about programming. Don't treat it like a homeework
                assignment, or a chore. Treat it like you're finally getting to play with that cool new toy you got for Christmas. Remember, ask for help if you get stuck. </p>

            <div class="exercise"> II. Video in HTML5</div>
            <p>
                If you want to feature a video from YouTube or some video hosting site, you can easily do so by embedding it. Nowadays, many sites make this easy. You can often right-click on the video, choose "Copy embed code" and paste it into your html doc. What's
                copied is something like this: &ltiframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/J---aiyznGQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt&lt/iframe&gt
            </p>
            <p> Simply adjust the width and height attributes to the appropriate size, and you're done. 'Frameborder' is a boolean attribute (meaning it has two values, "on" or "of") that indicate whether or not you want to have a border. 0 is "off", 1 is
                "yes."
            </p>
            <p> Say you have a .mp4 or .ogv file on your computer (say something you've filmed yourself, or an animated clip you've made with Flash) that you want to include on your website. Again, the easiest way to do so is to host the video through a site
                like Youtube and embed it on your site as above. The upside is that video hosting sites will automatically convert your video into the various formats required by browsers. The downside of that is if you want your video to play exclusively
                on your website. If that's the case, you'll have to host it, which takes a few more steps </p>
            <p> The main consideration when hosting your own video is including all the various formats supported by different browsers, including AVI, Flash, MPEG, Quicktime, and more. Fortunately, HTML5 (which unfortunately is not supported by all browsers)
                makes this easy with its &ltvideo&gt element. If you're interested in using HTML5 to embed video into your page, use the following links (ordered by usefulness) to learn more: </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Flash and HTML5<a href="http://www.wufai.edu.tw/information_technology_center/datasheet/HTML%20and%20CSS%20design%20and%20build%20websites.pdf">Chapter 9, pgs 211-216</a></li>

            </ol>
            <div class="exercise"> III. Audio in HTML5 </div>
            <p> As with video, there are different ways to embed audio into your webpage. The first is through a hosted service like Soundcloud.com that allows you to upload your audio; this route also provides an audio player that you can embed in your page
                - making it really easy. The second method is harder, and relies on Flash. The third is through using HTML5's built-in &ltaudio&gt element. To delve into any of these methods, use the following links:</p>

            </p>

            <div class="exercise"> IV. Geolocation in HTML5 </div>
            <p> * NOTE: The following tutorials pretty much all same the same thing -- so you only have to look at one or maybe two. If you get stuck, check out another way that might be getting at the same lesson in a different way. We all have different
                learning styles, and part of being a web developer (or programmer in general) is learning to research, research, research until something clicks.</p>

            <div class="exercise"> V. Form in HTML5 </div>
            <p>Let's add a form to your site! Navigate through the following tutorials for guidance:</p>
            <ol>
                <li> For the basics, scroll down to <a href="http://www.wufai.edu.tw/information_technology_center/datasheet/HTML%20and%20CSS%20design%20and%20build%20websites.pdf">Chapter 7, Pages 144-172</a> of Jon Duckett's <em> HTML & CSS </em></li>
                <li> For a more in-depth look at forms, check out <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Forms/My_first_HTML_form"> this </a> website</li>
                <li>Where does the data go? That's a bit beyond the scope of this course -- to actually retrieve the data, you'd have to implement a few methods using Python, Ruby, or PHP. Fortunately, you now have the research skills to learn those languages
                    on your own! If you want a sneak peak about the underlying mechanics of the form, check out <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Forms/Sending_and_retrieving_form_data"> this </a> article</li>
                <li> And if you're still SUPER intrigued by the form, read <a href="http://apress.jensimmons.com/v5/pro-html5-programming/ch8.html"> this </a> article about everything and anything you could possibly want to learn about html5 form </li>
            </ol>

            <p> That was great. You just learned a lot about HTML!
