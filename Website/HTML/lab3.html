        <div class="exercise">OVERVIEW</div>
        HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. It's what you use to create the bare-bones layout of your website. Think of HTML as a plain ole' Word Document with just the content, and CSS as the styling (font, color, bold, size, etc.).
        <div class="exercise">LEARNING OBJECTIVES</div>
        <ol>
            <li> Understand the basic building blocks of an HTML5 Doc </li>
            <li> Feel comfortable cloning a website in HTML</li>
            <li> Add style to your page with CSS</li>
        </ol>

        <div class="exercise">I. Group Warmup</div>
        <p> As a warmup, open up your favorite text editor, and whip up a basic HTML5 doc with header, a few articles, main content, footer </p>
        <div class="checkoff">
            <p> Hint: can you use the same selector for header, articles, content, and footer? If so, how do you distinguish between the elements? If not, what's the alternative?</p>
            <p> Hint to the hint: there's more than one right answer.</p>
            <ul>
        </div>

        <p> Lesson 1: Tags, Attributes, & Semantic Markup </p>
        <ol>
            <li> <span class="emphasis">Tags </span>are like containers -- they 'hold' information. They are always enclosed in &lt &gt brackets. Most tags include a starting and closing tag like so:
                <pre class="output"><span class="input"> This is a line of text </span></pre> Notice in this example that the closing tag has a forward slash ('\').
                <p> <a href="http://www.danfergusdesign.com/classfiles/generalReference/html5reference.php">Here's </a> a list of the most common tags in HTML5</p>
            </li>
            <li> <span class="emphasis">Attributes</span> tell us more about the elements. Most attributes can be used only on certain elements, but a few (like "lang") can be used on any elements.
                <pre class="output"><span class="input"> &ltp lang="en-US" &gt Paragraph in English &lt/p&gt</span></pre>
            </li>
            <li> <span class="emphasis">Semantic Markup</span> refers to HTML text elements that are not used for markup, but instead add some style to the page -- like bolding, underlining, and italicizing (to name a few).</li>
            <p>Rather than paraphrasing the key Text elements you can use in your web page, let's read Chapter 2 of Jon Duckett's <em>HTMl & CSS: Design and Build Websites </em> which you can find <a href=""> here </a> FOR FREE (this is an AWESOME resource)</p>
            <p> SKIM over pages 40-90 (don't worry - most are pictures and things you've seen before, so you don't need to read it in any detail)</p>
        </ol>

        <div class="checkoff"> Pro Tip: It's best practice to do as LITTLE styling in your HTML file, since styling is mainly CSS territory. You may think that adding an &ltem&gt &lt/&gt tag to your text isn't a big deal. And you're right -- it's okay to use sparingly. But
            what if down the line you wanted to change the italic font to bold...then you'd have to sift through your <em> entire </em> html file to find all the times you used the emphasis tags. Wouldn't it be easier to use the &ltspan&gt tag instead?
            That way you can just go to your SINGLE style.css file and change one line of code, instead of (potentially) hundreds....(we'll learn more about CSS soon).
        </div>
        </ol>
        <br/>
        <div class="exercise"> II. Clone This Website</div>
        <p> Now you're ready to pair program! Partner up with someone for the next exercise. We're going to clone <a href=" http://www.berkshirehathaway.com "> this </a> website i.e. create an exact replica.
            <div class="checkoff">
                <p> Pro Tip: Pair programming is often harder than it sounds. It's all about developing the right workflow to allow both people to contribute. WHat you <em> don't </em> want to happen is have one person type, while the other is on her phone
                    playing Pokemon Go. So here's one suggestion: tradeoff typing. While Person A is at the keyboard, Person B should still follow along and dictate lines of code for Person A to type in. After some time, switch.
                </p>
            </div>
            <ul>
        </p>
        <p> This exercise is going to incorporate a lot of the HTML elements that we've learned so far, including:
            <ul>
                <li> Different sized headers (h1-h6)</li>
                <li> paragraphs (p)</li>
                <li> ordered and unordered lists ('ul' vs 'ol')</li>
                <li> header and footers </li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p> Notice how the links are lined up in two nice columns? That's accomplished with a <span class="emphasis"> TABLE </span></p>
        <p> This is something new that we haven't yet learned...so we're going to learn it now! Read about the table <a href="http://www.tutorialspoint.com/html/html_tables.htm"> here </a></p>
        <p> Still confused? Have no fear, Jon Duckett is <a href="http://www.wufai.edu.tw/information_technology_center/datasheet/HTML%20and%20CSS%20design%20and%20build%20websites.pdf">here </a>(pages 130-140)</p>
        <div class="checkoff"> Pro Tip: When designing the layout of your website, developers often use a 'dummy language'' called Lorem Impsum, which is used as a placeholder for the actual content. This allows designers to worry about the layout and style of the page rather
            than the text, which they can fill in later. To use Lorem Impsum, check out <a href="http://www.lipsum.com/"> this </a> free online generator </div>
